# Repository for the Stanford Deeplearning.ai Machine Learning Specialisation.

##### This repository has the assignment lab notebooks that I had to complete in the specialisation.

##### In these notebooks various types of algorithms that are present in machine learning have been implemented.
##### Supervised Algorithms like Logistic Regression with and without regularization.
##### Neural Networks using Tensorflow(Keras).
##### Unsupervised Algorithms and Reinforment learning.
